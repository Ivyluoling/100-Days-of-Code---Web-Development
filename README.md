# HTML-CSS-JavaScript-Basics Repository

Welcome to my HTML-CSS-JavaScript-Basics Repository! 

The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured learning path for mastering basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques. 
It includes practical exercises that demonstrate how to display content on static webpages and manipulate it using JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) techniques.

Followed instructions from online tutorials, the milestone game project "Tic Tac Toe," which synthesizes the skills acquired in this repository. 
This project is showcased more extensively in the [Extracurricular-Projects Repository](https://github.com/Ivyluoling/Extracurricular-Projects).
