# Node.js Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository documenting my learning journey with Node.js! 
This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress, exploring Node.js features, and building backend applications.

16/05/2024 Today I installed Node.js, got a local server running with Node.js.

17/05/2024 Today I installed Express and nodemon packages to accelerate develop process. Also learned how to use express to post and get form data. Lastly, used nodemon to keep the browser synced with changes I made each time to the app.js file instead of reload "node app.js" and refresh to get the updates. One good thing is I try to change the folder name, but discard the changes later, and when I commit and push my updated files to github, error shows, and I manage to find the previous commits and merge it to the remote branch correctly with the help of ask ChatGPT.
